\chapter{Debugger and DOS}
\label{chap:debugger}
Pressing \fkey{D} in the freezer main menu takes you to the built-in debugger
with DOS functions.

Commands are entered in the command line at the bottom of the screen. Editing
inside the command line is possible in the usual manner. The cursor cannot leave
the command line. Using the arrow keys \fkey{CURSOR UP} and \fkey{CURSOR DOWN} ,
the previous commands can be recalled. The freezer keeps the last 4 commands
that were entered.

The debugger also supports the unfortunately little used \fkey{HELP} key.
Pressing this key displays a short help with an overview of all commands.
Using the keys \fkey{1}, \fkey{2}\dots you can navigate to the individual help
pages. Use \fkey{DEL} to display the previous page and \fkey{SPACE} or
\fkey{HELP} to display the next page. Every other key ends the help display.
The content of the command line remains unchanged when you enter the help.
This means you can also open the help while entering a command if you
forgot the exact syntax.
