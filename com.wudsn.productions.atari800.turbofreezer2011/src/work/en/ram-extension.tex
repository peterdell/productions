\chapter{512k RAM extension}

The built-in RAM extension of the \frz is compatible with the wide spread
Rambo/ATARI-Magazin extensions. Bit 4 of \freg{PORTB} activates access to the
extension (0 ~=~ extended RAM at \fhexr{4000}{7FFF} enabled, 1 ~=~ internal
Atari RAM enabled). The bits 2,3,5,6 and 7 select one of the 32 16k banks. A
separate ANTIC access, as it is present in the Atari 130 XE and some other
extensions, is not supported.
On the one hand, the required HALT signal is not available on the PBI bus. On
the other hand, there are only very few demos which require this mode. And
meanwhile most of them have been patched to work with RAM extensions that do not support
separate ANTIC access.

The following restriction may arise with programs which require a RAM extension
with separate ANTIC access. If a RAM extension which supports separate ANTIC
access is present in the Atari, activating the built-in 512k RAM extension of
the freezer may cause malfunction. If  ANTIC access to the RAM extension is enabled
(via bit 5 of \freg{PORTB}), but CPU (or combined CPU/ANTIC) access is disabled
(via bit 4 of \freg{PORTB}), the ANTIC will access the internal RAM extension
instead of the RAM extension of the \frz. The best solution is to prevent
this situation by disabling either of the RAM extensions.
