		<p> The purpose of <a href="http://www.wudsn.com/index.php/productions-atari800/tools/atariromchecker" target="_blank">Atari ROM Checker</a>
		    is to analyze and identify Atari 8-bit operating system ROMs based on their size
			and checksums. It contains a database of all known shipped or prototypes Atari operating system ROMs. The download also
			contains a simple automatic ROM dumper in Atari BASIC that runs on all Atari 8-bit machines with BASIC. Just boot the
			"AtariROMDumper.atr" with BASIC enabled. It will create a 16k file "D1:OS.ROM" and an 8k file "D1:BASIC.ROM" you can analyze then.

		<p> "Atari ROM Checker" is implemented in Java which makes is compatible with all popular operating systems. In order to run

			<a name="Usage">Usage</a>
		</h2>
		You can use drag & drop to drop folders or files onto the window. You can drop multiple folders and files at the same time.
		Folders will be scanned recursively for files with file extension ".bin" or ".rom". For every file, an entry in the result
		list is created with it's details like the check sums contain in the file. If the check sum in the file do not match the
		computed check sums, an additional entry with the correct check sums is added in the result. You can compare multiple entries
		in the result by selecting them and pressing "Edit/Compare Entries...".
		<h2>ROM Definitions</h2>
		For every known ROM version, the file size, the CRC32 check sum, optionally the MD5 checksum and other information is
		available. The ROM version definitions are stored the "ROMVersions.csv" as ".CSV" inside the "AtariROMChecker.jar" file. The
		file is in ".CSV" format with separator ";" and encoding UTF-8.
		<p>ID: The listed IDs are not official Atari IDs but references to the existing Atari800 implementation and the related Atari
			OS source code by by Kr0tki (Tomasz Krasuski).
		</p>
		<p>Part Numbers: The Atari part numbers all start with the letter "C" for "chip" followed by a number. Hence the second
			character is the digit zero "0", not the letter "O", though this was sometimes mixed up in certain areas of the other
			documentation.
