			Welcome to "The!Cart Studio", the free cartridge image authoring tool
			for
			<a href="http://www.mega-hz.de/Angebote/THE!CART/THE!CART_EN.htm"
				target="_blank">The!Cart</a>
			,
			<a href="http://www.atarimax.com/flashcart/documentation/" target="_blank">Atarimax
				Maxflash Cartridges
			</a>
			and free-style binary cartridge images. The program enables you to
			create workbooks for cartridge images which contain one or more ROMs
			or executables. The workbook an then be exported in different
			formats. Besides plain binary images for usage if an EPROM or
			external flash programming device, emulator cartridge images to run
			the cartridge in emulators and flash programming disk images which
			can be booted or loaded directly from the Atari to flash the target
			flash module. You need a device and software that is capable of
			transferring the data from your PC to the Atari like for example
			SIO2PC (available
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/atari8warez/" target="_blank">here</a>
			and
			<a href="http://lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=98" target="_blank">here</a>
			) with

				target="_blank">AspeQt</a>
			or
			<a href="http://lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=23" target="_blank">SIO2SD</a>
			. For "The!Cart", you do not need a USB programmer device or other PC
			related hardware for programming. Because "The!Cart Studio" can also
			create plain binary export files for a workbook, you can of course
			also use an USB programmer device to burn or flash them into any kind
			of cartridge supported by the device.

		<h2>
			<a name="StartingTheProgram">Starting the Program</a>
		</h2>
		<p>"The!Cart Studio" is implemented in Java which makes is compatible
			with all popular operating systems. In order to run the program you
			need has Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit
			(JDK/SDK) with version 1.6 or newer versions installed. Using Java
			1.7 or newer is recommended because on the one hand Java 1.6 is out
			of maintenance and on the other hand, multi-selection in the file
			selection dialog will only work with Java 1.7 or newer versions.
			"The!Cart Studio" requires enough RAM available for the Java process
			to be able to export images. The amount of available RAM is display
			in the "About" dialog. It should be twice the size of the cartridge
			you want to export. So for a 128 MB "The!Cart" export, the program
			requires at least 256 MB. You can specify this when you start from
			the command line via "java -Xmx256M -jar TheCartStudio.jar". By
			default "The!Cart Studio" check if an update is available during the
			start. The check is performed in the background and has no impact on
			the startup time. You can disable this check in the options.
		</p>
		<h3>
			<a name="Windows">Windows</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Double-click "TheCartStudio.exe" to start the program. The
			"TheCartStudio.jar" file with the actual program must be present in
			the same folder. Alternatively you can run the program also from the
			command prompt ("cmd.exe"). In this case you can change the current
			path to the folder where "TheCartStudio.jar" is located and type
			"java.exe -jar TheCartStudio.jar" to start the graphical user
			internal. Alternatively the following parameters are supported when
			running from the command line.

		<h3>
			<a name="Linux">Linux</a>
		</h3>
		<p>After extracting the "TheCartStudio.sh" and the "TheCartStudio.jar"
			file from the download archive, the so called "executable bit" should
			already be set. In case it is not, you will see the following error
			message when you double-click one of the files.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/linux-executable-message.png" alt="After unpacking" />
		</p>
		<p>Open the file properties, set the executable flag as shown below
			for both files.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/linux-executable-properties.png" alt="Setting the executable bit" />
		</p>
		<p>
			The installation of the Java runtime normally registers itself as the
			default application for the file extension ".jar". So by simply
			double-clicking the "TheCartStudio.jar" file or by choosing "Open"
			from the context menu, the program should start. If that is not the
			case or if you get error messages reporting that there is not enough
			memory reserved for Java, you can double-lick the "TheCartStudio.sh"
			instead which sets the -Xms and -Xmx parameters of Java as required.
			<br />
			Please note that there is a
			<a
				href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/932274"
				target="_blank">known bug in Ubuntu</a>
			, for example 12.10 with openjdk7. It is tracked as "Unreadable menu
			bar with Ambiance theme in Java/Swing GTK L&amp;F" and causes the
			menu to appear too dark; making is barely readable with the standard
			desktop theme. Changing the desktop theme fixes this.

		<p>The folder "TheCartStudio.app" in the download is a native package
			which contains a small Java stub, the "TheCartStudio.jar" and some
			additional configuration files. You can start the app directly from
			the Finder. It also sets the -Xms and -Xmx parameters of Java as
			required to overcome the default of only 128MB heap space. Upon the
			first start you will have to open the app directly from the Finder
			via the "Open" entry in the context menu. Then you have to confirm
			the "TheCartStudio is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure
			you want to open it?" warning by pressing the "Open" button and
			authenticating the action with an administrator user.

		<p>
			The "The!Cart" enables you to create workbooks for cartridge images
			which contain one or more ROMs or executables. The workbook an then
			be exported in different formats. Besides plain binary images
			(".BIN", ".ROM") for usage if an EPROM or external flash programming
			device, emulator cartridge images (".CAR") to run the cartridge in
			emulators and flash programming images (".ATR") which can be booted
			or loaded directly from the Atari to flash the target flash module.
			Depending on the disk emulation you are using, you can export the
			workbook a single large programming disk image for use with
			<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/aspeqt-a8w-edition/"
				target="_blank">AspeQt</a>
			or as multiple 16 MB sized programming disk images for use with
			<a href="http://lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=23" target="_blank">SIO2SD</a>
			,
			<a href="http://www.abbuc-raf.de/" target="_blank">SIO2USB</a>
			or similar SIO device emulators. You can also export cartridge images
			in plain binary (".BIN") to burn or flash them to any kind of
			cartridge using a programmer device.

		<p>
			<img src="images/general-sequence.png"
				alt="Detailed sequence for creating workbooks and tranferring them to the cartridge" />
		</p>
		<p>
			In case you are creating workbooks for "The!Cart", you can make use
			of the native cartridge emulation feature and reuse the existing
			software for "Atari Maxflash" cartridge and "MegaCart". This means
			you can one the one hand directly use existing compilations and just
			add them as a single file. On the other hand you can use
			<a href="http://www.atarimax.com/flashcart/documentation/" target="_blank">Maxflash
				Studio
			</a>
			and
			<a href="http://www.abbuc.de/~bernd/4MB_FLASH_MEGACART/english/"
				target="_blank">MegaCart Studio</a>
			to create new compilations and images for these cartridges and then
			add them as a single file. Because the
			<a href="#ExtendedMenu">Extended Menu</a>
			of "The!Cart" also recognizes the menu systems of these two cartridge
			systems, it can optionally offer you the entries within these menus
			directly.

				alt="Detailed sequence for creating workbooks and tranferring them to the cartridge" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the different studios with their specific loaders can be useful
			in particular when adding ATR disk images. It is in the nature or ROM
			cartridges that no 100% emulation of standard disk handling is
			possible. Any kind of ATR emulation must use at least a little amount
			of the computer's RAM. And if a certain program uses this RAM area
			while loading from the cartridge, the loader will be overwritten and
			crash. The details on the different methods used can be found in the
			section
			<a href="#ATRDiskImages">ATR Disk Images</a>
			. The following table given an overview of the features supported by
			the individual loaders. With this information you can decide which
			loader might be the right one for you.

		<h2>
			<a name="UserInterface">User Interface</a>
		</h2>
		<p>The user interface of "The!Cart Studio" is localized and current
			comes with English and German screen texts. You can change the
			display language via the menu entry "Tools/Options...". The default
			value is "Automatic", which means that the language is determined
			automatically based on the language settings of the operating system.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/studio-options-dialog.png" alt="Options" />
		</p>
		<p>By default, only the most frequently used columns are display in
			the various tables. You drag &amp; drop to change the order of the
			columns. Clicking on column header with SHIFT or CONTROL held down
			extends the sort order by appending this column. This way you can
			sort by genre first and then by title for example. Clicking a column
			header without pressing SHIFT or CONTROL resets the sort order to
			that single column. You can also use the context menu to hide visible
			columns, unhide invisible columns and reset visibility and sort order
			to the default. All layout changes are saved automatically when the
			program is closed. This also applies to the size and the position of
			the main window and to the different folders that were last used for
			loading/saving workbooks, adding entries and exporting cartridge
			images. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/workbook-entries-table-header-context-menu.png"

		<h2>
			<a name="CreatingWorkbooks">Creating Workbooks</a>

		<p>
			In the "File" menu you can find the usual "New", "Open", Save", "Save
			As" and "Close" actions. When "The!Cart Studio" is opened, a new
			unnamed project is already prepared. You can display the dialog to
			edit the workbook options via the menu entry "Edit/Workbook
			Options...".
			<br />
			<img src="images/workbook-options-dialog.png" alt="Workbook options" />
		</p>
		<h2>
			<a name="AddingEntries">Adding Entries</a>
		</h2>
		<p>You can add files for new entries via the menu entry "Edit/Add
			Entries...". The file chooser has multi-selection enabled, that means
			you can select multiple files at once and add them in go.
			Alternatively you can use drag &amp; drop to drop one or multiple
			files onto the window to add entries. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/add-entries-file-chooser.png" alt="Selecting one or more files to add" />
		</p>
		<p>"The!Cart Studio" contains a database of popular ROMs and will
			assign the correct title automatically based on size and the CRC32
			checksum of the file. If no matching entry is found in the data, the
			title of the entry is defaulted from the file name by removing the
			file extension.
		</p>
		<p>
			When new files are added, they remain at their original location
			first. When you save the workbook, all newly added files will be
			copied into the data folder (".tcd") of the workbook. This way you
			have all files and the workbook together in one location. As a
			consequence,
			<i>a file in the workbook is uniquely identified by its
				case-insensitive file name, irrespective of the folder it was
				originally copied from.
			</i>
			Adding files with the same file name will result in a confirmation
			dialog where you can choose to overwrite the existing file in the
			data folder with the new file, rename the file automatically during
			copying or to skip the new file, leaving the existing file in the
			data folder unchanged. The choice can either be applied to the
			current file only or to the current file and all following files.

		<h3>Entry Properties</h3>
		<p>
			The information for every entry is displayed in the columns of table
			on the "Entries" tab". Only the most important columns are visible by
			default. They are show with bold names on the table. You can
			configure the visibility and order of the columns as described in the
			section

					<a name="ATRDiskImages">ATR Disk Images</a>
				</td>
				<td>
					This is the standard Atari disk image format used in emulators.
					Many disk based programs that are available in this format can also
					be started from flash cartridges. But there are some natural
					limitations arising from the fact that loading the ATR images
					requires a simulation of the SIO routines that are located in ROM
					of the original Atari OS. For example the code for the simulation
					must be located in the RAM and may be overwritten when the loading
					from the ATR disk image starts. In addition the banks of the flash
					cartridge have to be activated during the SIO operation to load the
					data of the ATR disk image. As a consequence a program that uses a
					display list, graphics or interrupts in the cartridge memory area
					will run into problems. Also programs that try to write data to the
					disk will fail when run from an ATR simulation. For the simulation
					itself two approaches are used,
					<i>Modified ATR Disk Images</i>
					and
					<i>Modified Atari OS in RAM</i>
					. It depends on the individual ATR disk image and its programs
					which of them will work best.
					<p>
						<b>Modified ATR Images</b>
						<br />
						This is the approach used by the "Extended Menu" of "The!Cart".
						When you add an ATR file directly to a workbook, the file is
						analyzed and all potential code locations that call the Atari OS
						SIO routines are identified. For disks that contain a known DOS
						(DOS 2.0S, DOS 2.5, MyDOS) and its "DOS.SYS" file, only the
						sectors that belong to that file are patched by default. For disks
						that contain the
						<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
						, only the sectors of the Bootmanager are patched. For all other
						disks, the complete disk is scanned for usages of the SIO and that
						may potentially result in some false positives you have to removed
						manually from the parameters. The result of this analysis is
						stored in the "Parameters" column in the form "base=$100,
						$123=SIOV, $456=DSKINV". This column is hidden by default and can
						be made visible via the context menu of the table. When the
						workbook is exported for to the Atari, the calls at the found
						offsets are modified to point to the SIO simulation which as
						located at the address specified with the "base=$...." parameter.
						The advantage of this approach is that it works also on Atari 400
						an Atari 800 machines that do not have RAM under the OS and for
						software that uses the RAM under the OS like for example "Turbo
						Basic XL 1.5" or "The Brundles". And by specifying the
						corresponding parameters it will work even for software that uses
						nonstandard SIO routines instead of the Atari OS SIO routines like
						for example "MyPicoDOS". The disadvantage of this approach is that
						it will not work with program where the code that calls the SIO
						vectors is packed or encrypted in the ATR disk image. The
						following parameters are supported. Numbers are given in
						hexadecimal notation and are just example values. In the appendix
						<a href="#CompatibilityPatches">Compatibility Patches</a>
						you can find a list of known parameter combinations for programs
						that don't work with the default parameters.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							base=$100
							<br />
							This specified the base address for the SIO simulation code which
							is less than 256 bytes in size. The default base address is $400.
							If the ATR disk image crashes while loading, it might be the case
							that the program overwrites this memory area. For example
							MyPicoDOS uses the memory location $400-$40f during loading. To
							solve this problem you can change the base address to $410 for
							example. Other good choices for base addresses are $100, $400,
							$480,$500,$600 and $100. Just try which one works for the
							specific program.
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=SIOV
							<br />
							The two bytes starting at offset $123 are changed to the start
							address of emulation code for the SIOV vector ($e459).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=&lt;SIOV
							<br />
							The byte at offset $123 is changed to the low byte of start
							address of emulation code for the SIOV vector ($e459).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=&gt;SIOV
							<br />
							The byte at offset $123 is changed to the high byte of start
							address of emulation code for the SIOV vector ($e459).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=DSKINV
							<br />
							The two bytes starting at offset $123 are changed to the start
							address of emulation code for the DSKINV vector ($e453).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=&lt;DSKINV
							<br />
							The byte at offset $123 is changed to the low byte of start
							address of emulation code for the DSKINV vector ($e453).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=&gt;DSKINV
							<br />
							The byte at offset $123 is changed to the high byte of start
							address of emulation code for the DSKINV vector ($e453).
						</li>
						<li>
							$123=SELECTEDITEMNUMBER
							<br />
							The two bytes at offset $123 is changed to memory location which
							contains the item number of the selected menu entry. This can be
							used to modify inner menus to skip the selection and start the
							selected entry automatically. The item numbers are counted
							starting at zero. For example if you select the a menu entry
							which represents the 3rd item on a disk based ATR disk image, the
							values in the memory location will be "2".
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you messed up the parameters somehow, you can simply add the
						ATR disk image again to the workbook and choose to overwrite the
						existing file in the workbook. In this case, the analysis is
						performed again and a default for the parameters is generated.
					</p>
					<p>The SIO simulation in this approach supports both the read ("R",
						$52) and the status ("S", $53) command for "D1:". The status
						command set the 3 density bits of the "DVSTAT" status based on the
						density and size of the ATR disk image. Using other disk units
						than "D1:" results in the error code "130 - Nonexistent Device".
						Using commands than "R" and "S" results in the error code "132 -
						Unknown command".
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Modified Atari OS in RAM</b>
						<br />
						This is the approach used by the "Atarimax Maxflash" Menu or
						"MegaCart" Menu. The operating system is copied to the RAM under
						the OS ROM and is then modified to load the "disk sectors" from
						the flash cartridge instead of the real disk. The advantage of
						this approach is that it works equally for all software that uses
						the standard Atari OS SIO vectors, even if the SIO relevant code
						on the ATR disk image is packed on encrypted. The disadvantage is
						that the approach will not work on machines like the Atari 400 or
						Atari 800 that do not have RAM under the OS like the Atari and not
						with programs that use the RAM under the OS themselves. You can
						use the
						<a href="http://www.atarimax.com/flashcart/documentation/"
							target="_blank">Maxflash Studio</a>
						or
						<a href="http://www.abbuc.de/~bernd/4MB_FLASH_MEGACART/english/"
							target="_blank">MegaCart Studio</a>
						to create 128 KB, 1 MB or 2 MB collections with ATR disk images.
						Both studios come with proven emulation and provide several
						options to specify how the disk image shall be handled. You can
						then export the collection as BIN or CAR cartridge image and add
						it to the workbook.

					<p>
						<b>Directly as single file</b>
						<br />
						Executable files (COM,EXE,XEX) can be added directly to the
						workbook. While adding files directly is very convenient, the
						worst case waste of space is 8191 bytes per file. Therefore it is
						recommended to use the below mentioned options instead, if you add
						many executable files.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Included with multiple files on an ATR disk image</b>
						<br />
						The most compatible and most space efficient way to run these
						files is to copy them together with the required DOS onto an disk.
						For execuable files which load additional data like fonts from
						separate files, it is even the only valid way. And while adding
						executable files directly in the workbook is possible, adding them
						onto an ATR disk image with the
						<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
						first, and then adding the ATR disk image has advantages. You can
						create ATR disk images which represent compilations and also work
						on real disk drives. In addition, ATR disk images work with
						sectors of 128 or 256 bytes. So if multiple file are copied to one
						disk, at most 127 or 255 bytes of space are wasted per file on a
						full disk. The

						contains many disk images which are already prepared with the

						<b>Included with multiple files on an "Atarimax Maxflash" or

			<b>Important: If The!Cart does not start anymore after flashing
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			In very rare cases, for example when I/O errors corrupt the first few
			banks of The!Cart, you may not be able to enter the menus or the
			built-in flasher anymore from The!Cart itself. Then you have the
			following options:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Download latest disk version of the flasher from
					<a href="http://www.horus.com/~hias/thecart/software" target="_blank">Atari
						flashing software
					</a>
					.
				</li>
				<li>Insert the "thecart.atr" from the download archive in disk drive
					1.
				</li>
				<li>Hold down the OPTION key during power-on. You will then either
					end up in the simple menu and can try to update from there. If
					there is no extended menu on the cartridge, the cartridge disables
					itself completely and the computer will boot from disk.
				</li>
				<li>If even holding down OPTION does not disable The!Cart, hold down
					the SELECT key instead during power-on. The cartridge disables
					itself completely and the computer will boot from disk.
				</li>
				<li>If even this does not disable The!Cart, you need a Turbo-Freezer
					or similar monitor program, so you can disable The!Cart during
					power-on by writing the value $00 to address $D5A6. If you have a
					Turbo-Freezer, hold down the freezer button and power-on the
					computer. Enter the debugger by pressing "D" and enter "CD5A6<00".
					Then press RESET to let the computer boot.
				</li>
				<li>
					If all this fails, you can try
					<b>the strictly not recommended way</b>
					and hot-plug The!Cart. This may damage your cartridge and you
					computer. First boot the flash from disk without The!Cart inserted.
					You are prompted to press the RESET button on The!Cart. Insert the
					cartridge carefully and completely. Press the RESET button on the
					cartridge and then press RETURN on the computer. The flasher will
					report if and which cartridge was detected.
				</li>
				<li>You can flash the cartridge as described in the previous
					section. If the problem remains, try flashing again and answer the
					question "incremental update" with "n".
				</li>
				<li>Now your The!Cart works again. If not, feel free to contacts us.

		<h2>
			<a name="ExtendedMenu">Extended Menu</a>
		</h2>
		<div>
			Pressing the RESET button on the "The!Cart" cartridge followed by
			pressing the RESET button on your Atari will take you to the menu. If
			the cartridge contains the extended menu, holding OPTION while
			pressing RESET on the Atari starts the simple menu. This allows for
			starting the built-in flasher and update the extended menu in case it
			does not work properly. Holding SELECT while pressing RESET on the
			Atari disables the cartridge completely. This allowes for starting
			booting the flasher from a disk drive.
			<br />
			You can use the joystick or the keyboard to control the extended
			menu. You can narrow list by selecting the tab of a genre. The tab
			"All" always contains all entries. You can narrow down the list
			within a genre tab by typing any word or part of the title of the
			entry you are looking for. The search will find the entry no matter
			if something is in lower case or upper case. You can also use the
			joystick and the cursor keys to scroll though the result list. You
			can use the following controls:
			<ul>
				<li>HELP / ATARI - Display the help menu</li>
				<li>DELETE - Delete the last character from the search term.</li>
				<li>Joystick UP, cursor UP or "-" - Move the cursor line up.</li>
				<li>Joystick DOWN, cursor DOWN or "=" - Move the cursor line down.
				</li>
				<li>FIRE or RETURN - Start the selected entry. Lock the the
					cartridge configuration to prevent changes.
				</li>
				<li>FIRE+SHIFT or RETURN+SHIFT - Start the selected entry. Don't
					lock the the cartridge configuration.
				</li>
				<li>RETURN+CONTROL - Start the selected entry's cartridge menu, if
					there is one. Lock the the cartridge configuration to prevent
					changes.
				</li>
				<li>RETURN+SHIFT+CONTROL - Start the selected entry's cartridge
					menu, if there is one. Don't lock the the cartridge configuration.
				</li>
				<li>Joystick LEFT, cursor LEFT - Select next genre to the left</li>
				<li>Joystick RIGHT, cursor RIGHT - Select next genre to the right
				</li>
				<li>TAB - Toggle the details display mode of the selected entry
					between readable and technical information
				</li>
				<li>ESC - Exit the extended menu and start the simple menu. From
					there the flash can be started also.
				</li>
			</ul>
			The most recent version of the CPLD logic for the "The!Cart"
			cartridge supports a configuration lock. The configuration lock
			ensures no software can unintentionally or maliciously change the
			contents of the "The!Cart" cartridge. If you have an early version of
			"The!Cart" cartridge, you can use a JTAG interface to
			<a href="http://www.horus.com/~hias/thecart/jtag-update-docs/"
				target="_blank">update the CPLD logic</a>
			. By default the configuration of "The!Cart" is locked when an entry
			is started. This means the configuration cannot be changed via
			software anymore until you press RESET button on the "The!Cart"
			cartridge. By pressing the "SHIFT" key as additional modifier when
			starting an entry, you can prevent the configuration lock. This can
			be useful when using software that is built to access the "The!Cart"
			cartridge in native mode, for example RAM disk drivers.

		<h2>
			<a name="AdvancedTopics">Advanced Topics</a>
		</h2>
		<p>A number of advanced features of "The!Cart Studio" that are not so
			interesting for the regular user are also available.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Displaying additional columns in the entries tab
				<br />
				By default only the most frequently used columns are visible on the
				entries tab. Using the context menu on the header row of table , you
				can make more columns information about the entry visible.
			</li>
			<li>
				Using fixed start banks
				<br />
				By default entries are assigned automatically to a suitable start
				bank and the user cannot change this assignment. For developers who
				want to create software that uses "The!Cart" directly, for example
				in "Flexi-Mode" to directly access the 128 MB, it may be required to
				put certain content in certain banks. To do this, use the context
				menu to make the column "Start Bank Fixed" visible". This column
				offers a check box and if the check box is active for an entry, the
				column "Start Bank" becomes editable for this entry and the entry is
				excluded from automatic bank assignment.
			</li>
			<li>
				Defining User Space
				<br />
				By default all banks of the flash cartridge are under control of
				"The!Cart Studio". But if you want, you can reserve a portion of the
				flash cartridge for direct flashing from the Atari. This portion of
				the flash cartridge is called "User Space". You can define the size
				of the user space in the workbook options. You can enter the size in
				bytes, kilo bytes or mega bytes, e.g. "1023 B", "8 KB" or "2 MB".
				The effective size of the user space rounded to the next full bank,
				depending on the bank size. In addition the size of user space
				automatically rounded to a multiple of the flash block size, i.e. to
				64 KB for the flash target types "Atarimax 128 KB/ 1 MB" and "Flash
				MegaCart 4 MB" and to 128 KB for "The!Cart 128 MB". The use space is
				always located in the last banks of the flash cartridge. This way
				the ATR programming images are shorter and the flash software does
				not overwrite the banks that belong to the user space.
				<br />
				Though the content of the user space is fully under control of the
				Atari you can still define entries with "The!Cart Studio" to start
				the content in the user space from the cartridge menu. Via the menu
				entry "Edit/Add User Space Entry" a new user space entry is added to
				the list. This type of entries does not have an associated file in
				the project. Instead it is mandatory to specify the content type and
				the start bank manually. Therefore these two columns become visible
				if a user space entry is added.
			</li>
			<li>
				Using a special version of the "The!Cart" Atari flashing software
				and standard menu
				<br />
				By default "The!Cart Studio" uses the Atari flashing software and
				standard menu that is included in the ".jar" file. In case you want
				to use a more recent or modified version of the
				<a href="http://www.horus.com/~hias/#thecart" target="_blank">"The!Cart"
					Atari flashing software and standard menu
				</a>
				instead of the version which is currently included in "The!Cart
				Studio", you can put the "cartmenu.rom" file in the same folder as
				the "TheCartStudio.jar". Whether the built-in or the external
				software is used and which version it has is displayed in the
				"About" dialog.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			<a name="TroubleShooting">Trouble Shooting</a>
		</h2>
		<p>In case of problems, just post your question to the forums
			mentioned at the beginning of this document. Frequent mistakes are
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You have used the wrong flash module type and size in the workbook
				options
				<br />
				Make sure you set the flash module type and size to the actual type
				and size of your cartridge. This is esp. important if you did not
				create the workbook yourself but download it from somewhere. Other
				people may have other hardware then you.
			</li>
			<li>
				Yout have used the wrong menu in the workbook options
				<br />
				Make sure you set the flash module type to "Extended Menu" to get
				the Google-like search. This is esp. important if you did not create
				the workbook yourself but download it from somewhere. Older
				workbooks use the "Simple Menu".
			</li>
			<li>
				You have use the wrong flashing mode in the flasher
				<br />
				Make sure you use "Program Cartridge" by default. Programming raw
				files or images is not required when using "The!Cart Studio". Make
				sure you use incremental flashing by default if it is available to
				save time. Non-incremental/full flashing is only required is nothing
				else helps. In non-incremental mode, all blocks (16 banks are 1
				block) of "The!Cart" are are explicitly erased to initialize the
				flash, even though the banks may have been empty already.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have used the "E) Erase cartridge" option in flasher
				<br />
				This completely erases all content in the Flash ROM, including the
				menu and the flasher. The empty cartrige will lock up the computer
				during the boot process. See section "If The!Cart does not start
				anymore after flashing" for the required steps. The first flash
				process will again erase all blocks (16 banks are 1 block) to
				initialize the flash, even though the banks may have been empty
				already.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For testing if your cartridge and the flasher work correctly, a
			number of test workbooks are available for
			<a
				href="http://www.wudsn.com/productions/atari800/thecartstudio/thecartstudio-test.zip"
				target="_blank">download here</a>
			. In case the computer does not even start with the cartridge
			inserted, you can try holding down the OPTION key during power-on to
			bypass the cartridge. The load the flasher program from disk instead
			and flash the cartridge again.

			<ul>
				<li>The long pending feature to mark entries as favorites is now
					working. If you set the favorite indicator for an entry, the
					initial list of entries in the extended menu only shows the
					favorites for the active genre. This way you can use the joystick
					or cursor keys to select from restricted list of entries. As soon
					as you start typing a search term, the favorite indicator becomes
					irrelevant and all entries are searched foe the search term.
				</li>
				<li>The search which was broken in the version 2019-12-24 is working
					again.
				</li>
				<li>The XEX loader now also handles files without RUNAD segment and
					file where the RUNAD segment is not the last segement correctly.
				</li>
				<li>The XEX loader now clears the cold start flag (COLDST, $244),
					like DOS would. This way programs that perform the start via
					changing the DOS vectors and jumping to a warm start can start
					correctly.
				</li>
				<li>The wait cursor is now also displayed while saving the files
					created via "File / Export" to indicate the program is still busy.

				<li>The tabbed display for the genres now only scrolls, if the
					select genre does not fit on the screen. This is what you'd expect
					from a tabbed visualization.
				</li>
				<li>The XEX loader now sets the BOOT? flag to $01, like a DOS would.
					This fixes problems with programs that rely on the XEX being loaded
					from a disk.

		<h4>2019-11-26</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Columns "Title", "Genre", "File Path" and "File Name" are now

				</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>2019-11-04</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Content type "Executable File" is now set automatically when
					executables files (COM,EXE,XEX) with a valid file structure are
					added.
				</li>
				<li>New content type "SAP Music File" has been added and is set
					automatically when Slight Atari Player files (SAP) with a valid
					file structure are added. These files will be supported directly by
					the menu in future.
				</li>

		</div>
		<h4>2019-10-28</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Executable files (COM,EXE,XEX) can now be added directly to the
					workbook. Previously they had to be copied to an ATR disk image or
					be included in an AtariMax ROM. The corresponding sections in the
					documentation have been updated. For now, only files with a valid
					RUNADR ($2e0) segment will start, just like under DOS 2.5.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					is now included in the The!Cart studio download and online help.
					While adding executable files directly in the workbook is possible,
					adding them onto an ATR disk image with the boot manager first, and
					then adding the ATR disk image has advantages. ATR disk images work
					with sectors of 128 or 256 bytes. So if multiple files are copied
					to one disk, at most 127 or 255 bytes of space are wasted. If you
					add executable files directly, you waste 8191 bytes of space per
					file in the worst case.
				</li>
				<li>In addition to the HELP key, the ATARI/INVERSE key now also
					displays a built-in help menu that explains all controls. This
					solves the problem that there is no HELP key on the Atari 400 and
					the Atari 800.
				</li>
				<li>If the application detects that a new version is available, it
					prompts the user if the download should be performed. If the user
					confirms the download of the new version, the current application
					instance is now closed automatically, so it's files can be
					replaced.

		</div>
		<h4>2019-08-29</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The default file name for the "Export To ATR Programming Images
					(16MB)" is now fixed to "Part.atr". The resulting export files are
					then named "Part_1.atr" to "Part_9.atr". This ensures that devices
					like SIO2USB and SIO2SD, which only display "8.3" file names, can
					actually display the full file name and users do not mix up the
					parts.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2019-07-20</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The values for the reduced keyboard delay and increased repeat
					speed and now set only based on the PAL/NTSC type of the machine.
					This fixes the problem of the menu not being usable because the
					speed was too high if the OS has already set non-standard speeds.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2019-06-01</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The boot sequence now correctly disables and locks The!Cart if
					SELECT was pressed. This fixes the problem that The!Ramdisk driver
					sees The!Cart even though it is not usable.
				</li>
				<li>On Windows the TheCartStudio.exe can now be associated with the
					".tcw" file extension. This way you can have file type icons and
					open the workbook file via double click from the Windows Explorer
					or by dragging workbook file on the executable or its link.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2019-03-02</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>New 48x48 icon for Window, Mac and Java.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2018-08-05</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Section "If The!Cart does not start anymore after flashing"
					added in this documentation.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2018-07-17</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Titles defaulted from the file name are now correct, also if the
					file name contains multiple period characters.
				</li>
				<li>The ATR loader no longer sets a temporary blank display list to
					prevent flickering if the screen DMA is already disabled via SDMCTL
					($22F). This keeps the screen from remaining black after loading in
					cases where the program directly writes to DLISTL/DLISTH
					($D402/$D403). This is the case for Bandits.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2018-06-17</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The preview option ("CTRL-T") has been enhanced. When no or no
					valid path to an emulator is configured in the global options and
					no default application for ".car" files is registered, a file
					chooser dialog now prompts for selecting the emulator executable to
					be used. If a valid executable is chosen, it is also saved in the
					global options. Note that there is currently a bug in the JDK, so
					detection not always works. See
					<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8204537">JDK-8204537</a>
					. You can work around this by manually entering the path in the
					oprtions.
				</li>
				<li>The ATR loader now clears the memory locations $80-$ff and from
					the end of the loader (around $2000) to $9fff before the boot
					process. This fixes incompatibilies with programs that assume these
					locations to be zero, like for example Turbo-Basic XL 1.4.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2018-06-06</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug added in the 2018-05-05 version that can prevent
					entries from being added when they are in the cartridge database.
				</li>
				<li>If the title derived from the file name and the title in the
					cartridge database are equal, no confirmation dialog is displayed
					anymore.
				</li>
				<li>Content type "XEGS 32 KB" is now correct mapped to the The!Cart
					mode for "XEGS 32 KB" instead of "Switchable XEGS 32 KB" in the
					extended menu. With this cartridges that use bank numbers with bit
					7 set now work correctly, for example "Castle Crisis".
				</li>
				<li>Usage of the SHIFT modifier is now the same in the expert menu
					and the extended menu. When starting and entry with SHIFT, i.e.
					FIRE+SHIFT, RETURN+SHIFT or RETURN+SHIFT+CONTROL, the configuration
					registers of The!Cart remain unlocked. Using the CONTROL modifier
					in addition, i.e. RETURN+CONTROL or RETURN+SHIFT+CONTROL indicates
					that the inner menu of the cartridge containing the entry is
					started instead of starting the entry directly. Note that
					FIRE+CONTROL alone cannot be detected on the Atari due to way POKEY
					works.
				</li>
				<li>
					Built-in MyPicoDOS and flasher software from hias updated from
					version 4.05T (2014-04-07) to 4.06T (2017-09-24);
					<ol>
						<li>Added .CAR file loader so you can load cartridge images up to
							512k from the disk into the The!Cart RAM without flashing them.
							very useful for fast test cycles during development.
						</li>
						<li>Attract mode is now disabled when using joystick navigation.
						</li>
						<li>Added directory and drive switching using joystick.
						</li>
						<li>Bugfix: Don't disable high speed SIO if reading a directory
							fails.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The generated unit test cartridges now contain more details
					including the The!Cart mode used for emulation. In addition the VBI
					is now still active, so the cartridge can be freezed using
					TurboFreezer to analyze problems on the real hardware.
				</li>
				<li>Import conversion for Williams 32 KB ROM is more robust now and
					always generates a new filename for the converted file.

			<ul>
				<li>Import of Maxflash Programming ATRs now automatically converts
					the ".ATR" file to a ".CAR" file only if the Atarimax bank
					switching scheme is supported by the flash target type of the
					workbook.
				</li>
				<li>Import of Williams 32 KB ".ROM" and ".CAR" files now
					automatically converts the file to a Williams 64 KB".CAR" file in
					case only the Williams 64 KB bank switching scheme is supported by
					the flash target type of the workbook.
				</li>
				<li>The new Atari800 cartridge types and corresponding content types
					for "Atrax 128 KB" (68), "aDawliah 32 KB" (69) and "aDawliah 64 KB"
					(70) have been added to the cartridge detection and unit test
					generation. Note that they are not supported by The!Cart itself.
					But if you have used "Atarax 128" (17) - which is supported by
					"The!Cart" - in your your existing workbooks, you have to
					re-classify the corresponding entries now as "Decoded Atarax 128"
					(17). This is an incompatible change but I want to be 100% in sync
					with Atari800 and its definitions.
				</li>
				<li>The cartridge database has been updated to Kr0tkis version from
					2018-04-24. Now 839 instead of 737 known titles, 807 instead of 717
					known content types.
				</li>
				<li>If a matching entry in the cartridge database is found when
					adding a file, the user is prompted to decide if the proposed title
					from the database should be used.
				</li>
				<li>The about dialog now also displays the number of supported
					content types.

			<ul>
				<li>Holding OPTION while pressing RESET on the Atari disables the
					cartridge now also if the extended menu used. If the cartridge
					contains the extended menu, holding SELECT while pressing RESET on
					the Atari starts the simple menu. This allows for starting the
					flasher and update the extended menu in case it does not work
					properly. Note: The function of these two key was swapped in later
					versions.

		<h4>2015-09-20</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The "Multiple Entries" feature is now more reliable for corrupted
					Atarimax menus and can handle menus with more than 70 entries
					correctly now. "Maxflash Studio only reserves about 2000 bytes for
					the title texts. Title texts are stored as variable length strings.
					Typically the entry space on the cartridge runs out for the entry
					data, before the title space runs out for the titles. But due to a
					missing warning in Maxflash studio, the title space can overwrite
					the entry space if many long titles are used. The!Cart studio now
					tries to detect that situation and stops at the last correct entry.
					See

			<ul>
				<li>"TheCartStudio.app" for Mac OS X users now works correctly and
					allows to start the application directly from the finder.
				</li>
				<li>
					New modifier key "CONTROL" is evaluated when starting an entry to
					disable the default configuration lock. This can be useful when
					using software that is built to access the "The!Cart" cartridge in
					native mode, for example RAM disk drivers. See
					<a href="#ExtendedMenu">Extended Menu</a>
					for details. Note: This was changed to "SHIFT" in newer versions.
				</li>
				<li>
					New section
					<a href="#TroubleShooting">Trouble Shooting</a>
					added to the documentation. It also contains a download link to an
					archive including test workbooks for different sizes of cartridges
					and all supported cartridge types. for details.
				</li>
				<li>
					Description the flashing process for "The!Cart" added to section
					<a href="#ProgrammingFlashCartridges">Programming Flash Cartridges</a>
					of the documentation.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2015-04-26</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The download now contains a "TheCartStudio.exe" for Windows
					users. This wrapper program comes with a proper icons, a version
					and location test for the Java Runtime and the required Java
					parameters to ensure enough heap memory is available.
				</li>
				<li>The download now also contains a "TheCartStudio.sh" for Linux
					users. This script provides Java with the required parameters to
					ensure enough heap memory is available.
				</li>
				<li>The download now also contains a "TheCartStudio.app" for Mac OS
					X users. This one is still very experimental and is not yet tested
					as I don't own a Mac OS X machine. But I wanted to get this version
					out now.
				</li>
				<li>Online help has been revised. New sections and diagrams in now
					explain the overall workflow and creating and flashing workbooks.
					Also the different options to add files directly or via Maxflash
					Studio and MegaCart Studio are now explained.
				</li>
				<li>The selected line in the extended menu now uses black text and a
					more constant and darker flashing. This reduces bending and
					artifacts on CRT TV.
				</li>
				<li>Player missile graphics of the extended menu are now disabled
					correctly before an entry is started. That was an issue for example
					with Flop Magazine 56 Intro.
				</li>
				<li>An exception that occurred with ATR files that do neither have a
					boot manager menu nor are DOS 2.5 disks is fixed.
				</li>
				<li>New Atari software version 2014-04-07 included. It includes a
					fix for the CAR or MyPicoDOS when loading OSS modules.
				</li>
				<li>The "-createSampleFiles" command now correctly creates separate
					folders "ROM-Correct", "ROM-Size-Too-Small", "ROM-Size-Too-Large".
				</li>
				<li>Console output for error messages is now routed to "System.err",
					so the command line can properly distinguish between information
					and error messages.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-09-25</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The last entry on from
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					disks is now visible in the extended menu. Thanks to Frank for
					pointing out the bug.
				</li>
				<li>New cartridge type "67 - XEGS 64 KB cartridge (banks 8-15)"
					added to list of recognized cartridge and content types for
					completeness.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-09-24</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Bootable ATRs without DOS 2.x or MYDOS are now correctly recognized
					again. They had worked before and became broken with the support
					for the
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					ATR disk images.
				</li>
				<li>The new menu entry "Tools/Preview" allows for a testing preview
					of the complete cartridge export and its menu in an emulator, just
					as in the Maxflash Studio. For the preview, the workbook is
					exported as ".car" file with a fixed name into the temporary folder
					of the user. A previously existing preview is overwritten
					automatically. If no path to an emulator executable,is configured
					in the options, "The!Cart Studio" tries to open the ."car" file
					with the associated default program of the operating system. Only
					if that fails, it will ask you to maintain the full path to the
					emulator, for example to "Altirra.exe" or "atari800.exe", in the
					options.
				</li>
				<li>The modifier key for menu entries should now be "Command"
					instead of "Control" on Mac OS X.
				</li>
				<li>The buttons for choosing the bank colors are now also correctly
					displayed on Windows XP.
				</li>
				<li>The "Check for Updates during Start" setting in the options is
					now saved correctly when the program is closed.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-09-22</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The export now also generates a ".txt" index file with the title
					and origin of all menu entries. So you can use the file system
					search of your operating system function to find games in exports.
					The index file also contains the information the for example
					"Amaurote 128 (130 XE)" is one of the menu entry that stems from
					the "Multiple Entries" setting for the workbook entry with the
					title "GAMES403" stored in "GAMES403.ATR"."
				</li>
				<li>The resident part of the SIO simulation that must be present
					after booting has been reduced from 231 to 148 bytes. This makes is
					possible to use the stack area with "base=$100" also. Since that
					part of the stack will be unused most cases, it has become the new
					default base address. Yet there may be programs that use that area
					for example during unpacking, so you'll have to try other values in
					case it doesn't work there.
				</li>
				<li>The ATR analysis now patches DOS disks correctly also in case
					the "DOS.SYS" is not stored starting at sectors 4 but on other
					parts of the disk. Example: "Asteroids.atr" by Norbert Kehrer
				</li>
				<li>
					In the new appendix
					<a href="#CompatibilityPatches">Compatibility Patches</a>
					you can find a list of known parameter combinations for programs
					that don't work with the default parameters. This includes fixes
					for OS-B only games (Popeye) or file versions with plain bugs
					(Bounty Bob).
				</li>
				<li>Pressing RETURN to start the selected entry now correctly starts
					the entry even if the search is still active. Before RETURN was
					interpreted as ESC in this case and the simple menu was started.
				</li>
				<li>
					Menu entries from double density
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					disks with more than 9 entries (i.e. more than 1 directory sector)
					now appear correctly in the extended menu. Example: "GAMES009.ATR".
				</li>
				<li>The documentation has been extended with the description on
					starting Java with enough memory to export large workbook. The
					about dialog now displays the amount of memory that is available in
					Java. Errors that occur during the export due to insufficient
					memory are no caught and displayed in the status bar. This was a
					problem on Mac OS X 10.9 where the default heap size for Java is
					128 MB on some machines.
				</li>
				<li>
					The new parameter "$123=SELECTEDITEMNUMBER" can be used to patch
					menu code of ATR images to directly load the correct menu item. For
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					disks, this is done automatically already now. So you can start all
					of them from the extended menu without bothering with the actual
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					menu.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-09-16</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>"The!Cart Studio" now automatically checks if a newer version is
					available on the web site during startup. If a newer version is
					available, a dialog box is displayed and the download can be
					triggered directly by pressing "Yes". For those who have a slow
					internet connection or simply don't like automatic updates, the
					check can be disabled in the options. You can then use the "About"
					dialog to display the local and the version available on the web
					site.
				</li>
				<li>
					The analysis of the ATR with respect to SIO patching has been
					improved. For disks that contain a known DOS (DOS 2.0S, DOS 2.5,
					MyDOS) and its "DOS.SYS" file, only the sectors that belong to that
					file are patched by default. For disks that contain the
					<a href="#BootManger">Bootmanager by Mike Langer</a>
					, only the sectors or the Bootmanager are patched. For all other
					disks, the complete disk is scanned for usages of the SIO and that
					may potentially result in some false positives you have to removed
					manually from the parameters. If you added ATR files to a workbook
					before and did not manually modify the parameters, you should add
					those files again. This will set the parameter to the new default,
					reducing the risk of wrong patches.
				</li>
				<li>Patches specified in the "Parameters" column for ATR files can
					now also be used for direct patching and pokes. You can specify a
					patch or poke as "$1234=$56" to set the byte at offset "$1234" in
					the disk image content to "$56" during the export. For example to
					make "Popeye" work on OS-C/XL machines you can specify "base=$0400,
					$011d=siov, $1101a=$ea, $1101b=$ea, $1101c=$ea" as parameters for
					the "GAME009.ATR" from HomeSoft.
				</li>
				<li>The ATR loader now correctly clears the RAM before the boot
					process. Before the RAM was unintentionally filled with a pattern.
					This resulted in graphics garbage in some programs that do not
					initialize the RAM themselves like Master of the Lamps.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-09-11</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A detailed description of all columns on the "Entries" tab and a
					description of the "Multiple Entries" setting for the "Display
					mode" have been added to the
					<a href="#AddingEntries">Adding Entries</a>
					section.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Multiple Entries" is now also supported for two disk based menus.
					Disks that contain the "Bootmanager" by Mike Langer or "MyPicoDOS"
					by Matthias Reichl are now supported. The long file names
					maintained in these menus will be listed in the extended menu and
					can be used for searching. You can find the huge archive of disk
					images that use "Bootmanager" on the
					<a href="http://www.mushca.com/f/atari" target="_blank">HomeSoft web site
					</a>
					. As a test all currently present 405 disk images with 2477 games
					have been added successfully and appeared correctly in the extended
					menu.
				</li>
				<li>Memory organization of the extended menu optimized. It now also
					works correctly on an Atari 400 with only 16k of RAM. Isn't that
					cool with 128 MB of ROM? The result list is now automatically
					limited based on the available RAM in the Atari. On a 16k Atari
					there is space for 512 entries in the result. On a 48k Atari there
					is space for 12.800 entries in the result.

				<li>Extended menu now also works with "The!Cart" cartridges with 32
					MB and 64 MB.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-07-18</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Download link and download version number are correct again now
					in the about dialog.
				</li>
				<li>Content type for CAR files of type "The!Cart 64MB" is not
					detected correctly.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-07-12</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>ATR simulation now also works on NTSC machines and some images
					that ended in a lock-up on PAL will also work now.
				</li>
				<li>ATR loading speed has been increased again by 50% for the cases
					where the destination address is not overlapping with the ROM area.
				</li>
				<li>Sorting tables by multiple columns is now supported. Clicking on
					column header with SHIFT or CONTROL held down extends the sort
					order by appending this column. This way you can now sort by genre
					first and then by title for example. Clicking a column header
					without pressing SHIFT or CONTROL resets the sort order to that
					single column.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-07-02</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Java 1.6 is now sufficient to run and use The!CartStudio. This
					is particularly valuable for Mac OS X users, because there Java 1.6
					is the default and Java 1.7 is still hard to install. The only
					limitation when using Java 1.6 is, that multi-selection in the file
					dialog will not be possible. But you can normally bypass that
					restriction using drag &amp; drop. 
				</li>
				<li>The SIO simulation for ATR entries based on the "Modified ATR
					Image" approach is now complete in the sense that both Single and
					Double Density disks as well as ATRs with non standard sector
					counts are supported. Due to a bug in the analysis code of the
					previous "The!Cart Studio" versions you may have to re-add the ATRs
					again to trigger a new analysis.
				</li>
				<li>Screen is now temporarily disabled when loading from a simulated
					ATR. This speeds up the loading by a factor of about 25. Before the
					routine was waiting for a blank screen area, which slowed it down
					dramatically and also could not work properly in many cases. So I
					decided to rather make the loading so fast, that you don't even
					realize that there would be a loading screen.
				</li>
				<li>
					A restriction has been added to prevent interchange issues with
					workbooks created on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac,
					Unicode vs. Non-Unicode). The problem appeared for example for
					"Q¤Bert" which causes a very cool special character on some file
					systems. The file names for files that are added to the workbook
					are now restricted to the following interoperable subset of the
					ASCII range:
					<pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!#$%&amp;'()+,-.;=@[]^_ </pre>
				</li>
				<li>Names of the genres are now automatically sorted in the workbook
					options. Empty genre names are now filtered out implicitly. The
					length of the genre name and the total allowed number of genres
					(128) is checked now. Changes to the genres list are detected
					correctly now.
				</li>
				<li>Direct start for inner menu entries now starts the correct entry
					number also in case some banks on the Atarimax cartridge are
					occupied by an Atari OS, for example OS-B.
				</li>
				<li>Some initialization errors in direct start inner menu entries
					are fixed now. Especially the handling of cold start and warm start
					settings for Atarimax menus is working better now. This is
					important for games that are reset proof and use a warm start for
					the initial startup like Frogger.
				</li>
				<li>The colors of the banks in the summary panel and in the banks
					tab can now be configured individually in the options. In addition
					there is a "Reset" button to reset the colors to the default
					values. Pressing "Cancel" in the options dialog now actually
					discards all the changes performed in the options dialog.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-04-03</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>RAM is now cleared before starting inner entries from Atarimax
					or MegaCart compilations. This will fix artifacts in programs that
					rely on this, for example Spy's Demise.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-03-18</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>ATR loader now correctly sets "DSTATS=1", making it more
					compatible with some disks.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-03-02</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>First version of filtering via genres is now working in the
					extended menu. Use joystick or cursor left and right to step
					through the genres. Visualization of the selected genre is not yet
					how I want it to be, but it works.
				</li>
				<li>HELP key now displays a built-in help menu that explains all
					controls.
				</li>
				<li>Initialization error in direct start for MegaCart's inner menu
					entries fixed (DLI vectors, BASIC not off after warm start).
				</li>
				<li>Some cartridges like for example Asteroids have the property
					that pressing the RESET button on "The!Cart" sometimes brings you
					to the extended menu by incident. This the case simply because they
					use the same memory area and pressing the button swaps the code.
					This can lead to garbage on the screen and a non working menu. Now
					the menu detects that the RESET button of "The!Cart" is still
					pressed during initialization (which is normally not the case). It
					then performs a cold start to ensure proper initialization, once
					the button is released.
				</li>
				<li>Keyboard definitions are now included directly in the extended
					menu, so it works correctly if an with "OldRunner" OS is active.
				</li>
				<li>TAB - Toggle the details display of the selected entry between
					readable and technical information.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-02-27</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Display type "Multiple Entries" is now also supported one
					additional older version of the Maxflash Studio menu. For the very
					first version, this also includes the direct start. Looks like
					there were as many releases of that software as for "The!Cart
					Studio" ....
				</li>
				<li>Direct start of MegaCart's inner menu entries from the extended
					menu is supported for the latest version of the MegaCart Studio
					menu. Thanks to Bernd for his support to make this possible so
					quickly.
				</li>
				<li>By holding down "SHIFT" when starting an entry that comes from
					an inner menu disables the immediate start and takes you to the
					inner menu instead.
				</li>
				<li>New Atari software version 2014-02-24 included. It includes
					fixes for the handling of the SPI EEPROM which stores the
					configuration of the simple menu.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-02-22</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Display type "Multiple Entries" is now also supported seven
					additional older versions of the Maxflash Studio menu. Those were
					the ones with "&lt;A&gt;,&lt;B&gt;,&lt;C&gt;" lists. So you can see
					and search the entries from the contained menu directly in the
					extended menu. 
				</li>
				<li>Direct start of Atarimax's inner menu entries from the extended
					menu is supported for the latest version of the Maxflash Studio
					menu.
				</li>
				<li>First - very experimental - support for ATR loading based on
					binary translation. Only non-encrypted single/enhanced density
					disks may work. This ATR loader supports loading of programs that
					use the RAM under the OS. For all other ATR stuff, you are
					currently better off with putting it into an Maxflash image or
					MegaCart Studio image.
				</li>
				<li>Sort order in the extended menu is now case insensitive.
				</li>
				<li>New Atari software version 2014-02-17 included with improved
					high speed handling.
				</li>
				<li>Timing bugs fixed that could cause the menu or cart to freeze
					during boot or ROM start, for example Asteroids.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-02-16</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Display type "Multiple Entries" is now also supported for the
					content types "MegaCart 512 K" and "MegaCart 2 MB" and for two
					older versions of the Maxflash Studio menu. So you can see and
					search the entries from the contained menu directly in the extended
					menu.
				</li>
				<li>Entries are now automatically sorted by title when you save a
					workbook, so the are sorted by default when you open the workbook
					the next time. Clicking on the column header of course changes the
					display sorting just like before.
				</li>
				<li>The recurring lockup with a black screen that was introduced in
					the last version should be solved now. After 28 years of Atari
					programming I found out that display list interrupts are triggered,
					even if the display list DMA and the screen is switched off. This
					again caused the VBI to not update the shadow registers to switch
					the DMA on because it assumed that is the VBI interrupts an
					interrupt, then this is probably the serial I/O. But this time it
					wasn't. Fortunately I have my Turbo Freezer and so I could find
					what is different on the real machine - because the issue never
					occurs in the emulator. Phew.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-02-13</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Search speed improved from 25s to 9s for a full search in 16.000
					entries with short names. When the search is finished, the elapsed
					time in frames is displayed.
				</li>
				<li>Scroll speed and acceleration adapted.
				</li>
				<li>Cursor keys now control the scrolling also without pressing
					pressed "CONTROL". This also means these characters are no longer
					available for typing in, which should not be a problem.
				</li>
				<li>Clearing of result lines when restricting the result now works
					properly.
				</li>
				<li>For Atarimax 128K/1 MB cartridges created with the recent
					Maxflash Studio, the display type "Multiple Entries" is now
					supported. The entries of the Atarimax menu will also appear in the
					extended menu search. Selecting such an entry starts the Atarimax
					menu it comes from. Direct start support will be added later. Due
					to a potential bug in the Maxflash Studio, only the first 70
					entries of the Atarimax menu are accepted to be on the safe side.
				</li>
				<li>New flash target types "The!Cart 32 MB" and "The!Cart 64 MB"
					added in the workbook options, because these sizes are requested
					and actually shipped now.
				</li>
				<li>New cartridge types "65 - The!Cart 32 MB" and "66 - The!Cart 64
					MB" added as they are because these sizes are requested and
					actually shipped now and also supported by Atari800.
				</li>
				<li>Definition of initial banks fixed. Now all cartridge types use
					initial bank 0 (again) except for CARTRIDGE_OSS_034M_16 (bank 1),
					CARTRIDGE_ATMAX_1024 (bank 127) and CARTRIDGE_MEGA_4096 (bank 254).
				</li>
				<li>New Atari software version 2014-02-09 included. This fixes the
					problem that SDX64, Express and Diamond cartridges were not started
					correctly due to a wrong initial bank register (was 7, must be 0).
					It also adds a new option to the flasher when starting the
					cartridge. You can now choose to enter the default (extended menu)
					or if you want to explicitly enter the simple menu directly. When
					entering the simple menu this way, the auto-start feature is
					disabled, so you don't start with the wrong bank after flashing new
					content.
				</li>
				<li>Command line option to generate sample cartridge files now
					generates correct files also for "Megacart 2MB" and all Atari 5200
					cartridge types..

		</div>
		<h4>2014-01-23</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>First version of Google like search and scrolling in the result
					list of the "Extended Menu" is now implemented. Some bugs still in
					there like cleaning the screen lines that are not part of the
					result, but for sure worth trying.
				</li>
				<li>The workbook options now allow all types of menus if the flash
					module type is "user defined". The "Simple Menu" and "Extended
					Menu" will of course only work if the actual cartridge later is a
					"The!Cart" cartridge.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>2014-01-17</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Title and genre column were not editable in the version from
					2014-01-15 because introducing the new data type for sorting
					disabled the default editor. This is fixed again now.

						</li>
						<li>- added retry option on I/O errors
						</li>
						<li>- don't print empty bank numbers
						</li>
						<li>- in non-incremental mode program checksum block after data
							has been programmed (like in incremental mode)
						</li>

					with binary order and not with locale dependent collation. This
					means "Atarimax 1 MB" now appears before "Atarimax 128 KB" both in
					the studio and in the menu.
				</li>
				<li>New flash target type "Turbo Freezer 2005 448 KB" added which
					can be used to create ".BIN" files with 56 banks and 8k, 16k, OSS
					and SDX bank switching.
				</li>
				<li>Flash target type "User Defined" now allows all content types,
					so you can create arbitrary image files with it.

				</li>
				<li>Cartridge type for "64 - MegaCart 2 MB" fixed, it was 63 instead
					of 64 so ".CAR" file were not recognized correctly.

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping to "The!Cart" mode $22 fixed for cartridge type "61 -

					tab. The size and position of the blocks now adapts better the use
					the available size of the window. Now 16.384 can be seen properly
					also in 1024x768 resolution.

					2004-08-25, 2005-04-09, 2009-08-15, 2011-10-03, 2012-04-07) with
					two different extraction algorithms. It was tested against 99
					different "ATR Programming Images" and successfully created working
					"CAR Images" for them.
				</li>
				<li>New cartridge types "CARTRIDGE_MEGAMAX_2048=MegaMax 2 MB" and
					"CARTRIDGE_MEGA_4096=Flash MegaCart 4 MB" added to the recognized
					content types in accordance with the new Atari800 definition.

					multiple of the flash block size, i.e to 64 KB for the flash target
					types "Atarimax 128 KB/ 1 MB" and "Flash MegaCart 4 MB" and to 128
					KB for "The!Cart 128 MB".

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Existing collections for 128 KB or 1 MB Maxflash cartridges are
					often only available as "ATR Programming Image" but not as "CAR"
